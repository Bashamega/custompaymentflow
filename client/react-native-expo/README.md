# Accept a payment examples in React Native (Expo)

## Requirements

- React Native Expo SDK version >= 41
- Expo Go client version >= 2.19.6.1011482

## How to run locally

This is the React Native (Expo) client for the sample and runs independently of
the server. To start the backend servers, choose from a list of several servers
available in the sibling `../server` directory. Running a backend server is a
requirement and a dependency for this React front-end to work. See the README in
the root of the project for more details.

To run the React Native Expo Go client locally:

1. Install dependencies

From this directory run:

```sh
yarn
```

2. Start the app and open Expo dev tools

```sh
yarn start
```
